Python Basics Assignment
Name: Manoj

I have attempted all 20 questions in this assignment.

Questions attempted:
1. String Manipulator
2. Age Calculator
3. Bill Splitter
4. Grade Calculator
5. Temperature Converter
6. Leap Year Checker
7. Ticket Pricing System
8. Simple ATM Simulator
9. Number Pattern Printer
10. Multiplication Table Generator
11. Sum and Average Calculator
12. Factorial Calculator
13. Prime Number Checker
14. Number Guessing Game
15. Palindrome Checker
16. Calculator Functions
17. Text Analysis Functions 
18. Number System Functions
19. Student Report Card style logic included
20. All completed


Challenges faced:
- Writing 20 programs back-to-back was tiring. Needed to stay consistent with style.
- Handling edge cases like factorial of 0, prime check for negative numbers, ATM minimum balance, palindrome ignoring case.
- Menu-driven programs took extra care to avoid crashes.
- Bonus features like hints in guessing game and full multiplication table needed extra testing.


Final note:
All 20 questions are done.  This assignment helped me practice Python basics properly and also taught me to think about edge cases and user experience.
